# Springboard-Apps-Project
Brief: Did Apple Store apps receive better reviews than Google Play apps?
1. Stages of the project: 
  Sourcing and loading
  Load the two datasets
  Pick the columns that we are going to work with
2. Subsetting the data on this basis
  Cleaning, transforming and visualizing
  Check the data types and fix them
  Add a platform column to both the Apple and the Google dataframes
  Changing the column names to prepare for a join
  Join the two data sets
  Eliminate the NaN values
  Filter only those apps that have been reviewed at least once
  Summarize the data visually and analytically (by the column platform)
3. Modelling
  Hypothesis formulation
  Getting the distribution of the data
  Permutation test
4. Evaluating and concluding
  What is our conclusion?
  What is our decision?
  Other models we could have used.
